## 📝 How to make a great feature request

1. First, [search the existing discussions](https://github.com/esphome/feature-requests/discussions) to see if your idea has already been suggested. If so, consider [voting instead](#️-vote-instead-of-duplicating).
2. If not, open the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/esphome/feature-requests/discussions).
3. Carefully select the category that best matches your feature request
4. Fill in the form with as much relevant detail as possible.
4. Clearly explain your idea:
   - What problem does it solve?
   - What’s your proposed solution?
   - Why is it important to you?
   - Are there any alternatives or workarounds?

## 🗳️ Vote instead of duplicating

Before creating a new discussion, search for existing feature requests. If you find one you like or agree with, use the **upvote arrow** at the top of the post or share your use case in the thread. This helps us understand what the community values most.

## 🗳️ How voting works

- Use the upvote arrow at the top of discussions you support
- Add comments to share your specific use case
- The most upvoted features help us understand community priorities
- Remember: votes guide us, but don't guarantee implementation; this is not a contest

## 📌 Keep in mind

- Not all feature requests will be implemented.
- ESPHome is an open source project powered by volunteers and contributors working in their spare time.
- Please respect everyone involved, and be mindful of the time and energy others have invested. Behind every contribution is a person.
- This space is covered by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/esphome/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Proposals should be realistic and actionable.
- Inactive or out-of-scope discussions may be closed.
- Not everything has to be solved within ESPHome itself—some feature requests may be addressed by third-party projects like external components.

## 💬 Join the conversation!

Your ideas and feedback are valuable. Together, we're building the best smart home devices in the world—ones that respect your privacy, run locally, and give you complete control.
